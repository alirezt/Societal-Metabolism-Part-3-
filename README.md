# Societal-Metabolism-Part-3

In previous parts (part one and Two) I explained very shortly about ESs and SM. Now, I want to statistically explore patterns between ESs and SM. For start, I explore standard and basic statistical analysis such as ordinary least square (OLS). Unlike machine learning, parametric algorithms in statistics, such as OLS assess the correlation based on features from all cases to calculate the statistical metrics (Miner, Nisbet, and Elder 2009). In statistics, the linear correlation is defined by R or Pearsonâ€™s product moment correlation coefficient (Mun 2014). However, we deal with nonlinear relationship in many cases of the real-life situations. Using nonparametric-based models instead of linear model are now ubiquitous in many of the scientific disciplines.

Therefore, I use both linear (parametric analysis) and non-linear (non-parametric analysis) regression analysis in order to carry out the initial statistical exploration of the dataframe. For non-linear analysis I applied GAM (generalized additive model) to the dataframe. GAM extends GLM (generalized linear model) by replacing linear predictor with additive predictor (Hastie and Tibshirani 1990).
